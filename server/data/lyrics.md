bang bang rap

```
It's Myx Moscato	It's frizz in a bottle
It's Nicki full throttle	It's oh, oh

Swimming in the grotto	We winning in the lotto
We dipping in the pot of blue foam so

Kitten so good
It's dripping on wood	Get a ride in the engine that could
Go, Batman robbin' it	Bang, bang, cockin' it	Queen Nicki dominant, prominent

It's me, Jessie, and Ari	If they test me they sorry
Ride us up like a Harley	Then pull off in this Ferrari

If he hanging we banging	Phone ranging, he slanging
It ain't karaoke night but get the mic	cause I'm singing

B to the A to the N to the G to the uh
B to the A to the N to the G to the hey
